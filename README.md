Included in this git repository is results (and scripts to produce the figures) from the study 'Constraining Remote River Discharge Estimation Using Reach-Scale Geomorphology' (https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027949). Note that many external (yet freely availble) datasets are necessary to run these scripts. Please consult the manuscript for where to access these.

The derivation of our river classification frameworks was performed in a jupyter notebook (in python). The R package implementation of our algorithm, geoBAM, is available at https://github.com/craigbrinkerhoff/geoBAMr
<br><br>
The river widths extracted from the Mackenzie River network are available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6vt45el17itpleg/AABXw7S58IIrAmsfwWzWVZ4Qa?dl=0.
